# Fcrypt

**Simple, secure file encryption from your terminal.**

`fcrypt` is a lightweight command-line and terminal UI application for encrypting and decrypting files using modern cryptography.

Whether it's a text file, image, PDF, archive, or document, `fcrypt` allows you to protect it with a password and restore it later with a single command.

Built for Linux with a minimal dependency footprint and a keyboard-driven interface.

## Security

`fcrypt` uses a modern encryption design:

- **AES-256-GCM** for confidentiality and authentication
    
- **scrypt** for password-based key derivation
    
- Random salt generated for every encrypted file
    
- Random nonce generated for every encryption operation
    
- Authentication prevents silent corruption and tampering
    

Encrypted file format:

```text
FCRYPT01 | salt | nonce | ciphertext
```

If the password is incorrect or the encrypted data has been modified, decryption fails safely.

## Why I Built This

Many encryption tools are either:

- Too complex for casual use
    
- Focused only on archives
    
- Require graphical interfaces
    
- Depend on external services
    

`fcrypt` was built to provide a simple workflow:

```bash
fcrypt enc file.ext
fcrypt dec file.ext.fcr
```

No accounts. No cloud storage. No unnecessary configuration.

Just secure file encryption from the terminal.

## Roadmap

- Windows support
    
- macOS support
    
- Batch encryption
    
- Directory encryption
    
- File shredding option
    
- Theme customization
    
- Package distribution on PyPI
